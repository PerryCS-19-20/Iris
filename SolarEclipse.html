       <center> <h1> SOLAR ECLIPSE </h1> </center>
      <hr>
      <center><h4> On August 21, 2017 there will be an eclipse of the sun!</h4></center>
      <p>This is where the moon will completely cover the sun and the sun's tenuous atmosphere-the corona-can be seen, will stretch from Lincoln Beach, Oregon to Charleston, South Carolina. Observers outside this path will still see a partial solar eclipse where the moon covers part of the sun's disk!</p>

       <center> <h2> What is a Solar Eclipse or an Eclipse in general you might ask?</h2> </center>
       <center><p> A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the sun and Earth and blocks all or part of the sun for up to about three hours, from beginning to end, as viewed from a given location.  For this eclipse, the longest period when the moon completely blocks the sun from any given location along the path will be about two minutes and 40 seconds.  The last time the contiguous U.S. saw a total eclipse was in 1979!! An eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon move into alignment with each other. One of the bodies blocks the view of another and creates a shadow. There are 2 different types of eclipses: solar and lunar. A lunar eclipse happens at nighttime and occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon creating a shadow on the Moon. These types of eclipses occur roughly 2 to 4 times per year. A lunar eclipse will generally last for a few hours</p></center>

        <center> <h2> Where can you see this amazing event? </h2></center>
        <center><ul>
            <li> The first point of contact will be at Lincoln Beach, Oregon at 9:05 a.m. PDT. Totality begins there at 10:16 a.m. PDT </li>
            <li> then,it will cross through Oregon</li>
            <li> then Idaho</li>
            <li> Wyoming </li>
            <li> Montana </li>
            <li> Nebraska </li>
            <li> Iowa </li>
            <li> Kansas </li>
            <li> Missouri </li>
            <li> Illinois </li>
            <li> Kentucky </li>
            <li> Georgia </li>
            <li> North Carolina </li>
            <li> Then the total eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT.</li>
        </ul></center>
        <center><h1> BUT BE CAREFUL! </h1></center>
        <center><h2> There are safety concerns you have to look for while trying to spot this solar eclipse! You never want to look directly at the sun without appropriate protection except during totality, you could severely hurt your eyes. But for safety purposes <a href="https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/safety">Click HERE</a> to learn more.</h2></center>
        <center><p> But if you have no way of getting these type of glasses there are other ways in seeing this life time event. By testing your craft and art skills. There are two ways to make it, but its basically a pinhole camera. First way, is to grab a large piece of cardboard and cut a whole through it. It does not have to be percise, size doesnt really matter. Then what you need to do is tape a piece of aluminum foil over the whole and poke a tiny hole, this time you have be careful, because you dont want to make the whole too big. Having a small hole, it emits less light but will create a sharper image. I advise you to use a tack, needle or a pin, those would work nicely. Now, you are done with the first method, go outside and test your pinhole, but holding it perpendicular to the sun. You should see a small bright dot on the other side of it. You're probably wondering why the dot is so small, well you can always move it closer or farther from the screen/sidewalk to make it appear bigger. If you dont paticularly like this method, DONT WORRY! There is another way. First you need to find a cardboard box, white is the best to use. But if you do not have a white box, its recommended to cover it in white paper or construction paper, to project it clearer. Tape up the edges to make sure light doesnt come in. Repeat the pinhole and aluminum foil step from the previous method to use the pinhole, look into the box (cover the opening with your face as much as possible) and point the hole end of the box towards the sun so that your face will be looking away from the sun. Inside the pinhole camera on the back side you should see an image of the sun.

    <center> <h1> TYPES OF SOLAR </h1></center>
    <center><ol>There are 4 different types of solar eclipses. How much of the Sun's disk is eclipsed, the eclipse magnitude, depends on which part of the Moon's shadow falls on Earth.
<li>Partial solar eclipses occur when the Moon only partly obscures the Sun's disk and casts only its penumbra on Earth.</li>
<li>Annular solar eclipses take place when the Moon's disk is not big enough to cover the entire disk of the Sun, and the Sun's outer edges remain visible to form a ring of fire in the sky. An annular eclipse of the Sun takes place when the Moon is near apogee, and the Moon's antumbra falls on Earth.</li>
<li>Total solar eclipses happen when the Moon completely covers the Sun, and it can only take place when the Moon is near perigee, the point of the Moon's orbit closest to Earth. You can only see a total solar eclipse if you're in the path where the Moon's casts its darkest shadow, the umbra.</li>
<li>Hybrid Solar Eclipses, also known as annular-total eclipses, are the rarest type. They occur when the same eclipse changes from an annular to a total solar eclipse, and/or vice versa, along the eclipse's path.</li>

     <center><h1> Solar Glasses </h1></center>
     <center><p> Solar glasses can be used to view the solar eclipse easier, you can purchase them for less than $20. These glasses should look like so--</p></center>

     <center><p>Looking directly at the Sun is unsafe except during the brief total phase of a solar eclipse (totality), when the Moon entirely blocks the Sun’s bright face, which will happen only within the narrow path of totality.
The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed Sun is through special-purpose solar filters, such as eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewers. Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses, even very dark ones, are not safe for looking at the Sun. To date four manufacturers have certified that their eclipse glasses and handheld solar viewers meet the ISO 12312-2 international standard for such products: Rainbow Symphony, American Paper Optics, Thousand Oaks Optical, and TSE 17.
Always inspect your solar filter before use; if scratched or damaged, discard it. Read and follow any instructions printed on or packaged with the filter. Always supervise children using solar filters.</p></center>
      <center><ul>
          <li>Stand still and cover your eyes with your eclipse glasses or solar viewer before looking up at the bright Sun. After glancing at the Sun, turn away and remove your filter — do not remove it while looking at the Sun.
</li>
<li>Do not look at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed Sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars, or other optical device. Similarly, do not look at the Sun through a camera, a telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while using your eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewer — the concentrated solar rays will damage the filter and enter your eye(s), causing serious injury. Seek expert advice from an astronomer before using a solar filter with a camera, a telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device.</li>
    <li>If you are within the path of totality, remove your solar filter only when the Moon completely covers the Sun’s bright face and it suddenly gets quite dark. Experience totality, then, as soon as the bright Sun begins to reappear, replace your solar viewer to glance at the remaining partial phases.</li>

    <center><h1> What happens to the Atmosphere when the eclipse happens?</h1></center>
    <center><p>This part of the atmosphere, called the ionosphere, absorbs extreme ultraviolet radiation from the sun, protecting life on the ground from its harmful effects.It’s also the stage for brilliant displays like the aurora borealis, which appears when charged material in interplanetary space skims the atmosphere. And the ionosphere is important for the accuracy of GPS signals and radio communication. This layer of the atmosphere forms when radiation from the sun strips electrons from, or ionizes, atoms and molecules in the atmosphere between about 75 and 1,000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. That leaves a zone full of free-floating negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions, which warps and wefts signals passing through it. Without direct sunlight, though, the ionosphere stops ionizing. Electrons start to rejoin the atoms and molecules they abandoned, neutralizing the atmosphere’s charge. With fewer free electrons bouncing around, the ionosphere reflects radio waves differently, like a distorted mirror. The shadow of the trees turn into little moons, the animals will be extremely confused because its going to be dark during day, the plants will get into their night positions even though its hours away.</p></center>
